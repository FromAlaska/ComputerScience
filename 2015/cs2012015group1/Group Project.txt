For this project you will be working in groups of two or three. The assignment will be to write encryption and decryption functions for the following three problems. 

You must write a function that encrypts and decrypts Morse Code https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code. 

You  must write a function which both encrypts and decrypts using the Caesar Cipher

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

You must also write a function which encrypts and decrypts a simple substitution cipher when provided with a key to do so. 


All three problems must use pointers and C-strings in their implementation. Vectors and std::strings are not allowed. 

A testing program will be provided this weekend for you to compare your results against before turning them in.

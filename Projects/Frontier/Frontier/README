Square Wave Generator
This class is for making sounds while in the screen.
This takes an 64-bit integer.
Similar to C code squareWaveGenerator(int)

How to use this code:
	- This program returns a pointer.
	- Call extern "C" short * squareWaveGenerator(int)
	- This is built for the Apple Macbook Late 2013.
	- I use the SFML Library, with the sf::SoundBuffer _soundBuffer; & sf::Sound _sound
	- Documentation on _nameBuffer.loadfromsamples(short *, Sample Size, channel(1,2),Sample Rate);
	- It's also same for Sound API functions that use
										_nameBuffer.loadfromsamples(short *, Sample Size, channel(1,2),Sample Rate);
	- I load the pointer into a buffer, using _soundBuffer.loadfromsamples(soundWaveGenerator(int),44100,1,44100);
	- It may help to use this code with an Apple device

Example of this code:
	- This function is defined in the SounManager.hpp class.
	- Inside loadBuffer(short*,44100,1,44100), the buffer is loaded from samples
